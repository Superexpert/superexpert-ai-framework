# Superexpert.AI Framework


This package enables you to extend the Superexpert.AI Platform by creating new plugins. You can use this package to create and easily share the following:

1. **Server Tools** - AI Model tools that execute on the server. For example, getWeather() or lookupStockPrice().
2. **Client Tools** - AI Model tools that execute on the client. For example, a modal dialog that pops up to ask for user confirmation.
3. **Context Tools** - AI Model tools that are used to provide additional context information. For example, the current time or the user profile information.
4. **Themes** - Custom CSS modules to style the Chat Interface.
5. **LLMs** - New Large Language Models (like DeepSeek).
6. **RAG Strategies** - New strategies for matching relevant chunks when using Retrieval-Augmented Generation.
